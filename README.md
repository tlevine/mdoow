Things to make
-------------------

### Compare distributions
Plot two histograms on top of each other, but with lines instead of bars.

Do the same in sound, with x as radius, left/right as positive/negative, and y
as pitch (in a Western scale). See if it is easier to hear differences.
Scale it so z(0) is the same note as 0 (higher octave though).

Other sound variables

* Timbre (sine, sawtooth, piano, &c.)
* slurred, staccato, accents
* whole notes, quarter notes, &c.
* rhythm
